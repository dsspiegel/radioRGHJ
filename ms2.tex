\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


Planets with strong magnetic fields may generate radio or X-ray emission when interacting with energetic charged particles. 
It has been known that Jupiter emits radio wave from the auroral region due to cyclotron-maser instability \citep{zarka1998}.  % due to the acceleration of the plasmas. \memoYF{?}.
Potentially, exoplanets can also generate radio emission through similar mechanisms, depending on their intrinsic magnetic fields and the density of surrounding plasmas, e.g. stellar wind particles and particles from Io-like moons. 
Observations of radio emission from Solar System planets imply an empirical relation that the radio intensity is proportional to the input solar wind flux going into each planetary magnetosphere, which is known as  ``radiometric Bode's law'' \citep{desch+kaiser1984}. 
Based on this law, it has been proposed that exoplanets in close-in orbits may be bright radio wave emitters because they are subjected to strong stellar wind and/or strong interstellar magnetic field, and thus can gain larger energy input. Motivated by such speculations, spectral radio intensity from known exoplanets have been estimated  \citep{farrell1999,zarka2001,Lazio2004,griesmeier2004,griesmeier2007a,griesmeier2007b,reiners2010}. 
In addition, young planetary systems where the stellar wind activity is stronger are also taken into consideration \citep{griesmeier2005}. 
Although the observational search for these radio signatures are underway, there is no clear detection claimed so far
\citep{bastian2000,george2007,stroe2012,hallinan2013,murphy2015}, 
while some indications have been obtained \citep{lecavelier_et_al2013,sirothia2014}. 

When stars less than $\sim$8~$M_\sun$ evolve off the main sequence,
they go through stages on the red-giant branch (RGB) and the
asymptotic-giant branch (AGB) where their radii and luminosities increase by orders of magnitude. 
Jovian planets in orbit around such stars can be transiently heated to hot-Jupiter temperatures ($\sim$1000~K or more) at distances out to tens of AU, depending on the star's mass; such planets are termed ``Red Giant Hot Jupiters'' (RGHJs) \citep{spiegel+madhusudhan2012}. 
They are also subject to a massive (but slow) stellar wind, as the mass-loss rate of such evolved stars are significant, ranging from $\sim  10^{-8} M_\odot$/yr to $\sim  10^{-5} M_\odot$/yr with the highest values for AGB stars \citep[e.g.,][]{reimers1975, schild1989, vassiliadis1993, schoier2001, vanloon2005}, much higher than that of the Sun, $\sim 10^{-14}M_\odot$/yr . 
On the assumption that the radio emission is correlated with the stellar wind, planetary companions around evolved stars could also generate bright radio emission. 

Based on this speculation, \citet{ignace2010} examined radio emission from known substellar-mass companions around cool evolved stars. They found that the low ionization fraction of the stellar wind of evolved stars suppresses their radio emission and leads to weak radio emission, probably below the detection limit. 

\color{red}
In this paper, we argue that the accretion of massive stellar wind onto the planets would emit strong X-ray, which would ionize the hydrogen atoms around the planets. The ionized stellar wind could then interact with the planetary magnetic field in the same way as Solar System planets do. 
We therefore provide optimistic estimates for highly evolved stars, simply extrapolating the radiometric Bode's law. 
We do not constrain ourselves to the systems known to have sub-stellar companions, given that the survey of exoplanets around highly evolved stars is not complete; rather, we investigate the parameter space where we can search for radio emission and examine the possibility to detect them with current and future instruments. 
\color{black}

In \S2, we describe our assumptions for stellar wind, planetary magnetosphere, frequency of radio emission, and the scaling of planetary radio emission. 
Then, we present an estimate of the spectral radio intensity. Then, we present  an estimate of the spectral radio intensity of RGHJs and compares them with what might be expected from canonical hot Jupiters.

\S4 discusses possible obstacles to detect radio emission from RGHJs, in particular the effects of intrinsic radio emission of evolved stars and the offsetting effect of the electrons spiraling down along the planetary magnetic field.

Finally, \S5 concludes the paper with a brief summary.

\section{Model}
\label{s:assumptions}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\memoYF{In the end the number of significant decimal digits is set to 1 or 2.}

Before estimating the frequency of planetary radio emission and the spectral radio intensity, we specify the property of the stellar wind of the evolved stars in \S\ref{ss:stellarwind}, and that of planetary magnetic field in \S\ref{ss:magneticfield}.  
Then, we discuss the framework to estimate the frequency and intensity of planetary radio emission in \S\ref{ss:model_frequency} and \S\ref{ss:model_intensity}, respectively. 



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Assumptions for Planetary Magnetic Field}
\label{ss:magneticfield}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We estimate the planetary magnetic field of general planets  
simply by scaling the Jovian magnetosphere at the surface $B_J \sim 10$ G. 
So far, several scaling relations for the planetary magnetic field strength  
have been proposed \citep[e.g.][]{russel1978,busse1976,stevenson1979,mizutani1992,sano1993,starchenko2002,christensen2006,christensen_et_al2009} %\memoYF{check!}
%(see \citet{griesmeier2004} or \citet{christensen2010} for the summary), 
which are summarized and compared with numerical simulations in \citet{christensen2010}. 
We write the scaling laws as follows:
%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation}
B^2 \propto \omega ^\alpha M_p^\beta t^\gamma \label{eq:Bscaling0}
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%
where $\omega $ is the spin rotation rate, $M_p$ is the planetary mass, and $t$ is the age of the planet. 
Fiducial values we employ are $\alpha = 0$, $\beta \sim 1$, and $\gamma \sim -0.43$, which are obtained based on the following assumptions. 

First, we adopt the scaling law proposed in \citet{christensen_et_al2009} \citep[see also][]{reiners2010}, which is based on the assumption that the ohmic dissipation energy is a fraction of available convected energy and was found to be in a good agreement with the numerical experiments over a wide parameter space and with known objects from the Earth to stars: 
%\memoYF{describe in more detail}:
%%%%%%%%%% 
%\begin{equation}
%B^2 \propto \rho_c r_c^{4/3} q_c^{2/3}, \label{eq:Bscaling} 
%\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
B_{\rm dynamo} ^2 \propto f_{\rm ohm}\;\rho_{\rm dynamo}  ^{1/3} \;  (Fq_o)^{2/3} \label{eq:Bscaling} 
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%
%where $\rho _c$ and $r_c$ are the density and the radius of the dynamo region, and $q_c$ is the internal convected energy flux in the core region. 
where $B_{\rm dynamo}$ is the mean magnetic field in the dynamo region, $f_{\rm ohm}$ is the ratio of ohmic dissipation to the total dissipation, $\rho_{\rm dynamo} $ is the mean density in the dynamo region, $F$ is the efficiency factor of order unity, and $q_o$ is the convected flux at the outer boundary of the dynamo region \citep[see][for the comprehensive description]{christensen_et_al2009}. 
Here, $f_{\rm ohm}$ and $F$ are assumed to be constant for the bodies considered in this paper. 
Dipole magnetic field strength at the planetary surface, denoted by $B$, is then scaled by
%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation}
B \propto B_{\rm dynamo} \left( \frac{r_{\rm dynamo}}{R_p} \right)^3.  \label{eq:Bscaling2}
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%
where $r_{\rm dynamo}$ is the radius of the outer boundary of the dynamo region. 
%
Note that the scaling law, equation (\ref{eq:Bscaling}), would be reasonable only for the rapidly rotating objects. Indeed, unlike canonical hot Jupiters, RGHJs are not subjected to tidal lock and we do not have to assume slow spin rotation rate for them \citep{spiegel+madhusudhan2012}. Thus, we implicitly assume that RGHJs we consider are rapidly rotating so that they generate  planetary magnetic fields through the same mechanism as Jupiter. 


In order to evaluate $\rho _{\rm dynamo}$ and $q_o$, we need a model of internal structure of planets. 
In this paper, we consider Jupiter-like gaseous planets and assume that the planetary radius is constant at $R_p = R_{p,J}$, because the numerical calculations show that the radii of gaseous planets over the range of $0.1 M_{p, J} < M_p < 10M_{p, J}$ (with core mass less than 10\%) are converged to $0.8 R_{p, J} < R_p < 1.2R_{p, J}$ within 1 Gyr \citep{fortney2007}. 
For the density profile, we assume a polytrope gas sphere with index $n=1$, which results in:
%%%%%%%%%% 
\begin{equation}
\rho [r] = \left( \frac{\pi M_p}{4 R_p^3} \right) \frac{\sin \left[ \pi \frac{r}{R_p} \right]}{\left( \pi \frac{r}{R_p} \right)}. \label{eq:rho_r}
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%
We determine the radius of outer boundary of the dynamo region, $r_{\rm dynamo}$, by assuming that the hydrogen becomes metallic when $\rho (r)$ exceeds the critical density $\rho_{\rm crit}=0.7\,\mbox{g/cm}^3$ \citep{exoplanets2006, griesmeier2007b}. The density of the metallic core, $\rho _{\rm dynamo}$ is obtained by averaging the density in the core. 
In the case of Jupiter, $r_{\rm dynamo, J} = 0.85 R_{\rm J}$ and $\rho_{\rm dynamo, J} = 1.899~{\rm g/cm}^3$  .  

The scaling of convected heat flux at the outer boundary, $q_o$, is obtained by dividing the age-dependent net planetary luminosity by the surface area of the core region, i.e., $4\pi r_{\rm dynamo}^2$. 
The model of luminosity evolution is taken from \citet{burrows_et_al2001} \citep[see also][]{marley2007}. Ignoring the relatively weak dependence on  average atmospheric Rosseland mean opacity, the result leads to:
%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation}
L \sim 1.84\times10^{-10} L_\odot \left( \frac{M_p}{M_J} \right)^{2.64} \left( \frac{t}{4.5 \rm~Gyr} \right)^{-1.3}  \, 	
\label{eq:burrowsLum}
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%
Therefore, we have
%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation}
q_o \sim q_{o, J} \left( \frac{M_p}{M_J} \right)^{2.64} \left( \frac{t}{4.5 \rm~Gyr} \right)^{-1.3}  \left( \frac{r_{\rm dynamo}}{r_{{\rm dynamo},\,J}} \right)^{-2}\, .
\label{eq:burrowsHeatFlux}
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%

Substituting equation (\ref{eq:burrowsHeatFlux}) into equation (\ref{eq:Bscaling2}) and given that $r_{\rm dynamo} $ does not change significantly, the magnetic field is roughly, we find that:
%%%%%%%%%% 
\begin{equation}
%B   &\sim &  10~{\rm G} \left( \frac{t}{4.5~\rm{Gyr}} \right)^{-0.43} \left( \frac{M_p }{M_{p,J}} \right)^{1.38} \label{eq:scalingB} \\
B   \sim   10~{\rm G} \left( \frac{M_p }{M_{p,J}} \right)^{1.04} \left( \frac{t}{4.5~\rm{Gyr}} \right)^{-0.43} \label{eq:scalingB}
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%
under this model. 



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Assumptions for Stellar Wind}
\label{ss:stellarwind}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

One important factor in modeling the radio emission due to the interaction between stellar wind and the planetary magnetic field is the density and velocity of stellar wind. 
The number density of electrons in the stellar wind, $n$, can be expressed as
%%%%%%%%%% 
\begin{equation}
n = \frac{\dot M_\star}{4\pi a^2 m_p v}
\label{eq:n}
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%% 
where $\dot M_\star$ is the stellar mass loss rate, $a$ is the orbital distance from the star and $m_p$ is proton mass, and $v$ is the velocity of the stellar wind. 

The mass-loss rate, $\dot M_{\star }$, may be expressed in terms of the stellar radius in unit of solar radius, $R_{\star }$, the stellar luminosity in unit of solar luminosity, $L_{\star }$, and the stellar mass in unit of solar mass, $M_{\star }$ \citep{reimers1975}:
%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation}
\dot M_\star [M_\odot{\rm /yr}] \sim 4 \times 10^{-13} \eta \left( \frac{R_{\star }}{R_{\odot }} \right)\left( \frac{L_{\star }}{L_{\odot }} \right) \left( \frac{M_\star}{M_\odot} \right)^{-1}
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%
where $\eta \sim 0.3-3$. 
For example, for a star with $R_\star = 100 R_\odot $, $T_{\rm eff} = 4000 K$ (and thus $L_\star  = R_{\star }^2 T_{\star }^4 \sim 2262 L_\odot $) and $M_\star = M_\odot $ gives $\dot M_\star \sim 10^{-7} M_{\odot }$/yr. 
This is about 7 orders of magnitude larger than the solar mass loss rate, $\dot M_\odot \sim 2\times 10^{-14} M_{\odot}$/yr \citep[e.g.,][]{hundhausen1997}. 
The mass loss rate can be even as high as $10^{-5} M_\odot{\rm /yr}$ during the AGB phase
\citep{schild1989, vassiliadis1993, schoier2001, vanloon2005}. 


On the other hand, the stellar wind velocity becomes smaller because of the small escape velocity (due to the expanded stellar radius).
%\footnote{Escape velocity is $\sqrt{2GM/r}$.}
Assuming that the stellar wind scales as the escape velocity, i.e., $\propto \sqrt{2GM_{\star}/R_{\star}}$ ($G$ is the gravitational constant, $M_{\star}$ is the stellar mass, and $R_{\star}$ is the stellar radius), a Solar-mass red giant with radius $R_{\star}=100R_{\odot}$ encounters 10 times as slow stellar wind as that at the Sun, $v_{\odot}$. Thus, 
\begin{equation}
\frac{v}{v_{\odot}} \sim 10^{-1} . 
\end{equation}
%where $v_{\odot} \sim 4.0 \times 10^2 $ km/sec. 




\memoYF{comments on ionized fraction??}

\citet{drake1983}
%\citet{}


%The temperature of stellar wind of RGs is expected to be 2 orders of magnitude lower than their main sequence counterparts, mainly because the sound speed of hot corona exceeds the escape speed, i.e., hot corona cannot be confined in the stellar atmosphere \citep{suzuki2008}. 
%\begin{equation}
%\frac{T}{T_{\odot}} \sim 10^{-2}
%\end{equation}
%where $T_{\odot } \sim 10^6$ K. 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Frequency of Radio Emission}
\label{ss:model_frequency}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Planetary auroral radio wave are emitted at the local cyclotron frequency along the motion of the plasmas. The upper limit is around the cyclotron frequency of the planetary surface magnetic field, $f_{\rm cyc}$: 
%%%%%%%%%% 
\begin{equation}
f_{\rm cyc} = \frac{eB}{2\pi m_e} \approx 27.9 {\rm~MHz} \left( \frac{B}{10 \rm~G} \right) \label{eq:fcyc}
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%
where $e$ and $m_e$ are the charge and mass of the electron, respectively.
Using equation (\ref{eq:scalingB}), 
%%%%%%%%%% 
\begin{equation}
f_{\rm cyc} \sim  28~{\rm MHz} \left( \frac{M_p }{M_{p,J}} \right)^{1.04} \left( \frac{t}{4.5~\rm{Gyr}} \right)^{-0.43} . \label{eq:scalingfc} 
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%

Radio emission from the planet is observable from ground only when the maximum frequency is larger than the plasma frequency of Earth's ionosphere $f_{\rm plasma}^\oplus$ and the maximum plasma frequency along the line of sight $f_{\rm plasma}^{\rm los}$.
The plasma frequency may be expressed as
\begin{eqnarray}
f_{\rm plasma} & = & \sqrt{\frac{n_e e^2}{\pi m_e}} \\
 & = & 8979 {\rm~Hz} \times \left( \frac{n_e}{\rm cm^{-3}} \right)^{1/2} \, .
\label{eq:fplasma}
\end{eqnarray}
In the Earth's ionosphere, the electron number density is less than $10^6$~cm$^{-3}$, which implies that $f_{\rm plasma}^\oplus \lsim 10$~MHz.
At the favorable viewing condition, when the planet is on the near side of its star to the Earth, the maximum plasma frequency along the line of sight corresponds to that in the vicinity of the planet.
Therefore, combining Eq.~(\ref{eq:n}) and Eq.~(\ref{eq:fplasma}), we have
%%%
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:fplasmalos} f_{\rm plasma}^{\rm los} & \sim & 8.98 {\rm~kHz} \times \left( \frac{\dot M_\star}{4 \pi a^2 m_p v} \times 1\rm~cm^3 \right)^{1/2} \\
\label{eq:fplasmalos_scaled} & = & 14.7{\rm~MHz} \times \left( \frac{a}{5~\mbox{AU}}\right)^{-1} \left(\frac{v}{0.1 v_{\odot}}  \right)^{-1/2} \notag \\
 & & \times \left( \frac{\dot M_\star}{10^6 \dot M_{\odot}}\right)^{1/2} \, ,
\end{eqnarray}
%%%
%where in Eq.~(\ref{eq:fplasmalos_scaled}) we have taken the solar mass-loss rate $\dot M_\odot$ to be $2.0 \times 10^{-14}~M_\odot$/yr and the typical solar wind velocity $v_{\odot }$ to be 400~km/sec.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Flux of Radio Emission}
\label{ss:model_intensity}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The auroral radio spectral flux of exoplanets observed at the Earth, $F_{\nu}$, can be expressed by:
%%%
\begin{equation}
F_{\nu} = \frac{P_{\rm radio}}{\Omega l^2 \Delta f}
\label{eq:Fnu}
\end{equation}
%%%
where $P_{\rm radio}$ is the energy that is deposited as radio emission of considered frequency range, $\Omega $ is the solid angle of the emission, $l$ is the distance between the target and the Earth, and $\Delta f$ is frequency bandwidth. 

We estimate the radio emission of exoplanets, $P_{\rm radio}$, simply by scaling the Jovian auroral radio emission, $P_{\rm radio,\,J}$, with the input energy from stellar wind, in the same manner as \citet{griesmeier2005,griesmeier2007a,griesmeier2007b}. 
The scaling is based on the empirical/apparent good correlation between the radio emission intensity of Solar System planets and the input kinetic energy, $P_{\rm inp,\,k}$, or the magnetic energy of the solar wind, $P_{\rm inp,\,m}$, \citep[``radio Bode's law''; ][]{desch+kaiser1984}, i.e.,
%Namely, although the detail of the mechanism to generate planetary radio emission is not fully understood so far \memoYF{cite something?}, 
%observations indicate that the total radio emission, $P_{\rm radio}$ is proportional to the input kinetic energy, $P_{\rm k,\,inp}$, or the input magnetic energy, $P_{\rm m,\,inp}$ \citep[``radio Bode's law''; ][]{desch+kaiser1984}:
%%%
\begin{eqnarray}
P_{\rm radio} &\propto & P_{\rm inp} \\
P_{\rm inp,\,k} &=& n v^3 r_s ^2 \label{eq:Pinp_kin}, \\
P_{\rm inp,\,m} &=& v B_{\bot }^2 r_s ^2 \label{eq:Pinp_mag},
\end{eqnarray}
\memoTM{Somekind of plot of the typical ranges of these quantities might be useful/illustrative.}
%%%
where $ B_{\bot }$ is the interstellar magnetic field perpendicular to the stellar wind flow, and $r_s$ is the radius of the magnetic stand-off point. 
%In the case of the Solar wind, the kinetic energy is dominant input energy over the magnetic one (the former is $\sim 400$ times larger than the latter).  
It is not clear from the observations of the Solar System planets which is the fundamental one, the correlation to the input kinetic energy, that to the magnetic energy, or both. 
In this paper, we assume that the radio emission is scaled with the input kinetic energy, i.e., $P_{\rm radio} \propto P_{\rm k,\,inp}$ and consider the possible effects of massive stellar wind. 

On the other hand, in the case that the correlation with input magnetic energy is fundamental, it is difficult to estimate the planetary radio emission at this point because magnetic field of evolved stars are not well constrained for highly evolved stars; most of observations only set an upper limit \citep[e.g.,][]{konstantinova2010,petit2013,tsvetkova2013,konstantinova2013,auriere2015}. 
In the case of M-type giant EK boo, surface magnetic field $\sim 0.1-10 $G has been measured; In this particular case, given the large stellar radius $R_\star \sim 210 R_{\odot }$ the magnetic moment may be about $10^3$ times larger than the Sun and thus also may also increase the planetary radio emission. However, because of the lack of universal understanding of the stellar magnetic field, we leave the magnetic model of radio emission for evolved stars for future work. 

In reality, the total power of Jovian auroral emission varies greatly over time: $1.3\times 10^{10}$ W for the average, $3.2\times 10^{10}$ W for the average of highly active time, and $4.5 \times 10^{11}$ W for the peak activity \citep{zarka_et_al2004}. 
Here we employ $P_{\rm radio,\,J}=2.1\times 10^{11}\mbox{~W}$ as a canonical value, following \citet{griesmeier2005,griesmeier2007b}.
\memoYF{reconsidering...}

The radius of the magnetic stand-off point, $r_s$, is obtained based on the balance between the stellar wind pressure and the planetary magnetic pressure: 
%%%
\begin{equation}
m_p n v ^2 \sim \frac{B^2}{8\pi}\left( \frac{r_s}{R_p} \right)^{-6}  \label{eq:stand-off}
\end{equation}
%%%
The radius obtained for Jupiter from this equality is about a half of actual radius of Magnetosphere \citep[][]{griesmeier2005}. 
By scaling this radius with equations (\ref{eq:n}) and (\ref{eq:stand-off}), the radius of magnetosphere of planets would be estimated as:
%If the radius of magnetosphere is estimated by scaling that of Jupiter according to equations (\ref{eq:n}) and (\ref{eq:stand-off}), 
%We estimate $r_s$ simply by scaling Jovian magnetosphere \citep[$r_{s,\,J} \sim 84 R_J$;][]{joy2002} according to equation (\ref{eq:stand-off}), i.e., 
%%%
\begin{eqnarray}
r_s 
%&\sim & R_p \left( \frac{B^2}{8\pi m_{\rm p}nv^2} \right)^{1/6}  \\
&=& r_{s,\,J} \left( \frac{B}{10~\mbox{G}} \right)^{1/3} \left( \frac{a}{5.2\mbox{AU}} \right)^{1/3}  \\
&& \times \left( \frac{\dot M_\star}{\dot M_\odot} \right)^{-1/6}  \left( \frac{\dot v}{v_{\odot }} \right)^{-1/6} \\
&=& 11.3 \, R_J \left( \frac{B}{10~\mbox{G}} \right)^{1/3}  \left( \frac{a}{5\mbox{AU}} \right)^{1/3} \\
&& \times \left( \frac{\dot M_\star}{10^6 \dot M_\odot} \right)^{-1/6}  \left( \frac{\dot v}{10^{-1}v_{\odot }} \right)^{-1/6}
 \label{eq:stand-off-radius}
\end{eqnarray}
%%%

%Thus, the radio emission, $P_{\rm radio}$, or equivalently the input kinetic energy, $P_{\rm k,\,inp}$, are estimated with $n$, $v$, and $\mathcal{M}$, which should be specified by assuming the properties of the stellar wind and the planetary magnetic field. 
%In the following, we describe our assumptions for these properties. 

We assume that the solid angle of the emission is same as the Jupiter's one for all of the exoplanets. In reality, the solid angles of auroral radio emission from  Jupiter, Saturn, and Earth are $\sim 1.6$, $\sim $6.3, and $\sim $3.5, respectively \citep{desch+kaiser1984}, which are on the same order and will not significantly affect our order-of-magnitude estimate of radio emission. 

The bandwidth, $\Delta f$, is assumed to be proportional to the representative frequency of the emission, which is the cyclotron frequency, following the assumption of \citet{griesmeier2007b}.

Figure \ref{fig:planetaryB} displays the estimates of the strength of planetary magnetic field $B$ based on the scaling relation in \S\ref{ss:magneticfield} and the corresponding cyclotron frequency ($f_{\rm cyc}$), as well as the core radius ($r_c$), core density ($\rho_c$), and convected heat flux ($q_o$), as functions of planetary mass and the age. 

Note that the cyclotron frequency of Jovian planets typically falls between 10~MHz, the plasma cut-off frequency of Earth's ionosphere, and less than 1~GHz. 
In this regime, there are a number of current and near-future radio wave detectors including UTR-2, LOFAR, LWA, and SKA.

\subsection{Estimate of Radio Intensity of RGHJs in comparison with canonical HJs}
\label{ss:brightness}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Based on the assumption that the radio emission is proportional to the input kinetic energy (equation \ref{eq:Pinp_kin}), the scaling of the radio emission is expanded as follows:
%%%
\begin{eqnarray}
P_{\rm k,\,inp} &=& nv^3 r_s^2 = n v^3 \left( \frac{B^2}{2\pi m_{\rm p}nv^2} \right)^{1/3}  \\
&=& P_{\rm k,\,inp,\,J} \left( \frac{B}{B_J} \right)^{2/3} \left( \frac{a}{5.20~\mbox{AU}} \right)^{-4/3}  \notag \\
&& \times \left( \frac{\dot M_\star}{\dot M_{\odot}} \right)^{2/3} \left( \frac{v}{v_{\odot}} \right)^{5/3} \label{eq:Pkinp}
\end{eqnarray}
%%%

We may compare radio emission power of canonical hot Jupiters set at 0.05 AU  and that of RGHJs at 5 AU.
%Canonical values we adopt for planetary mass, orbital distance, and orbital period of each type as shown in Table \ref{tab:comp_HJ}. 
Then, equation (\ref{eq:Pkinp}) can be re-normalized as follows.
%%%
\begin{eqnarray}
P_{\rm k,\,inp} 
&\approx & 227 ~P_{\rm k,\,inp,\,J} \left( \frac{B}{B_J} \right)^{2/3} \left( \frac{a}{5~\mbox{AU}} \right)^{-4/3} \notag \\

&\approx & 2.27 \times 10^4 ~P_{\rm k,\,inp,\,J} \left( \frac{B}{B_J} \right)^{2/3} \left( \frac{a}{5~\mbox{AU}} \right)^{-4/3} \notag \\
&& \times \left( \frac{\dot M_\star}{10^9 \dot M_{\odot}} \right)^{2/3} \left( \frac{v}{10^{-1} v_{\odot}} \right)^{5/3}  \\
&& \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\; \mbox{(for AGB stars' companions)} \notag \\
&\approx & 489 ~P_{\rm k,\,inp,\,J} \left( \frac{B}{B_J} \right)^{2/3} \left( \frac{a}{0.05~\mbox{AU}} \right)^{-4/3} \notag \\
&& \times \left( \frac{\dot M_\star}{\dot M_{\odot}} \right)^{2/3} \left( \frac{v}{v_{\odot}} \right)^{5/3} \\
&& \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\; \mbox{(for canonical hot jupiters)} \notag 
\end{eqnarray}
%%%
Here we normalized the strength of magnetic field of canonical hot jupiters with $B_J$, due to the uncertainty of the magnetic field of tidally-locked planets. 
Depending on the modeling of magnetic field strength, there is also a speculation that the tidally-locked planets may have weaker magnetic field due to slow rotation \citep[e.g.][]{griesmeier2004}; in that case the radio emission would be even weaker. 
%\memoYF{This is based on theoretical prediction by \citet{griesmeier2004} that the tidally-locked planets have weaker magnetic field due to slow spin rotation. }

\end{eqnarray}
%%% 
%\memoYF{cite original paper!}. 
Thus, RGHJs are expected to be intrinsically as bright as the closest hot Jupiters, and Jupiter-like planets around AGB stars are potentially orders-of-magnitude brighter than them. 
Note that, within this framework, the {\it spectral} radio flux has  necessarily negative correlation with the planetary magnetic field, as pointed out by \citet{griesmeier2005}. 

Using the model for planetary magnetic field strength, we may consider the  radio spectral intensity and maximum frequency of given planetary mass and age. 
Figure \ref{fig:radio} shows the contours of spectral radio flux of planetary companions at 4.5~Gyr with varying masses and orbital distances. 
The target system is located at a distance of 10~pc from the Earth; the flux can be scaled by the distance as a quadratic function. 
The spectral radio emission from RGHJs at around 5-10 AU is found to be $\sim 10^{-6}-10^{-3}$ Jy when observed from 10-100 pc away. 

Observable energy flux is, however, limited by the plasma cut-off frequency in the vicinity of the planets, given by Eq.~(\ref{eq:fplasmalos_scaled}).
We can see emission only from where the cyclotron frequency (equation (\ref{eq:fcyc})) exceeds the plasma frequency:
%%%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:fcyc>fplasma} f_{\rm cyc} > f_{\rm plasma}^{\rm los}
\end{equation} 
%%%
The hashed regions in Figure \ref{fig:radio} indicate the parameter spaces where this criteria is not satisfied and thus the radio emission from the planet cannot be observed from the Earth. 

Equation (\ref{eq:fcyc>fplasma}) can also be rewritten as: 
%%%
\begin{eqnarray}
 \left( \frac{B}{10~\mbox{G}} \right) &>& 0.526 \left( \frac{a}{5~\mbox{AU}} \right)^{-1} \\
 && \times \left( \frac{\dot M_\star}{10^6 \dot M_{\odot}} \right)^{1/2}  \left( \frac{v}{10^{-1}v_{\odot}} \right)^{-1/2} \label{eq:Ba_limit}
\end{eqnarray}
%%%
or, 
%%%
\begin{eqnarray}
 \left( \frac{M_p}{M_{p,J}} \right) &> & 0.627 \left( \frac{a}{5~\mbox{AU}} \right)^{-0.72} \left( \frac{t}{4.5~\mbox{Gyr}} \right)^{0.31} \\
 && \times \left( \frac{\dot M_\star}{10^6 \dot M_{\odot}} \right)^{0.36}  \left( \frac{v}{10^{-1}v_{\odot}} \right)^{-0.36} \label{eq:Ma_limit}
\end{eqnarray}
%%%
In other words, given any orbital distance, there is a lower mass limit for a planet to be able to release the  radio wave out of the system. 
Substituting equation (\ref{eq:Ba_limit}) into equation (\ref{eq:F_nu_RGHJ}) leads to the maximum spectral radio flux at given orbital period:
%%%
\begin{eqnarray}
F_{\nu} &<& 1.30 \times 10^{-3}~\mbox{Jy} \left( \frac{d}{10~\mbox{pc}} \right)^{-2} \\
&& \times \left( \frac{a}{5~\mbox{AU}} \right)^{1/3}  \left( \frac{\dot M_\star}{10^6 \dot M_{\odot}} \right)^{1/2} \left( \frac{v}{10^{-1} v_{\odot}} \right)^{13/6}

\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 

In order to examine the potential to detect radio emission of RGHJs with the current and near-future instruments, we estimate the possible radio emission from known red giants assuming that they have planetary companions. 
For this purpose, we obtained the list of M-type red giants from Table 4 of \citet{dumm1998} with the data of mass, radius, and effective temperature.
For each red giant, the mass-loss rate is estimated by Reimers' equation \citep{reimers1975}:
%%%
\begin{equation}
\dot M_\star [M_\odot{\rm /yr}] \sim 4 \times 10^{-13} \left( \frac{R_{\star }}{R_{\odot }} \right)\left( \frac{L_{\star }}{L_{\odot }} \right) \left( \frac{M_\star}{M_\odot} \right)^{-1}
\end{equation}
%%%
where $R_{\star }$, $L_{\star } (=4\pi R_{\star }^2 T_{\star }^4)$, and $M_{\star}$ are radius, luminosity, and mass of the star. 
The velocity of stellar wind is assumed to scale with the escape velocity, hence
%%%
\begin{equation}
v \propto \sqrt{\frac{2GM_\star}{R_{\star }}}
\end{equation}
%%%
We also obtained the data of parallax from the original Hipparcos datasets\footnote{http://www.rssd.esa.int/index.php?project=HIPPARCOS} to compute the distance.

Using these estimates for stellar wind for equations (\ref{eq:stand-off}) and (\ref{eq:stand-off-radius}) as well as the distance to the target, we can calculate the maximum frequency and intensity of radio emission by specifying planetary mass and orbital distance of a hypothetical planetary companion. 
We consider [A] a Jupiter-twin whose cyclotron frequency is $\sim 30$~MHz, [B] a larger Jovian planet with $M_p\sim 2M_p$ of 4.5 Gyrs old whose cyclotron frequency is $\sim 70$~MHz, and [C] a larger Jovian planet with $M_p\sim 4M_p$ of 4.5 Gyrs old whose cyclotron frequency is $\sim 200$~MHz
  (equation (\ref{eq:scalingfc})).  

Figure \ref{fig:observability} displays the estimated radio intensity and the maximum frequency (i.e., cyclotron frequency) of Jupiters [A], [B], and [C]  around red giants within 100~pc. 
Jupiters are placed at 1 AU and at 5 AU for reference. 
The difference of the symbols indicates whether the radio emission can escape from the system (circle) or not (cross). 

%\memoYF{Up to where would the planet be engulfed by evolved stars? References?}
%I wondered this because if planets at 1 AU would be engulfed anyway it would not be worth discussing here. According to e.g. Nordhaus and Spiegel (2013) it is the case--however, some planets may migrate inward within 1 AU after evolution. So it should be ok. In any case this is not the main point of this paper and I would leave it out.

\subsection{Intrinsic radio emission of red giants stars}
\label{ss:RGradio}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

(Jason?)

The radio intensity of evolved stars in the range of 10~MHz and 1~GHz is not constrained through observation\memoYF{?}. 
Above 1~GHz, there are several observations. For example, \citet{gorman2013} reported $\alpha $ Boo ($R_\star = 25.4 R_{\odot }$, $T=4286$ K, $d=11.26$ pc) at 1~GHz is about 70 $\mu$Jy, and $\alpha $ Tau ($R_\star = 44.2  R_{\odot }$, $T=3,910$ K, $d=20.0$ pc) at 3~GHz is about 40 $\mu$Jy. 

We estimate the thermal radio flux from the host star to be consistent with these observed data and by extrapolating to the lower frequency range with a simple power law:
%%%
\begin{eqnarray}
f_{\star }(\nu ) &\sim & (0.4-1.375) \times 10^{-3} ~\mbox{Jy} \\
&& \times \left( \frac{d}{10 ~\mbox{pc}} \right)^{-2}  \left( \frac{R_{\star }}{100 R_{\odot }} \right)^2 \left( \frac{\nu}{1~\mbox{GHz}} \right)^{\alpha } 
\end{eqnarray}
%%%
If we assume $\alpha = 0.6$ based on constant property wind model \citep{wright1975,panagia1975,olnon1975}, radio flux at 10~pc from 10~MHz to 1~GHz is $\sim$ 25 $\mu$Jy-1 mJy, which is below the estimated radio flux of RGHJs. 
Note that it has also been suggested that the power index $\alpha $ is steeper than 0.6 \citep{gorman2013}, in which case the radio flux from the host star would be even lower.

\subsection{Back-reaction of a plasma flowing into a magnetic field}
\label{ss:offset}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

One might expect that plasma flowing into a region permeated by a magnetic field would, by spiraling around the field lines, generate an opposing magnetic field that partially cancels the intrinsic planetary magnetic field. 
To estimate the strength of this effect, consider a uniform flow of particles of charge $e$, mass $m$, and velocity $v$ into a region of magnetic field $B$, spiraling along the initial magnetic field. 
A single charged particle moving perpendicular to the magnetic field moves in a circular orbit of radius 
%%%
\begin{equation}
r=\frac{mv_\bot }{eB}.
\end{equation}
%%%
which creates a magnetic dipole
%%%
\begin{equation}
\mu = \frac{e}{2\pi r/v_\bot} \pi r^2 = \frac{1}{2} e r v_\bot = \frac{mv_\bot^2}{2B}.
\end{equation}
%%%
The volume integral of the canceling magnetic field $B_c$ generated by a single dipole $\mu$ is
%%%
\begin{equation}
\int d^3{\boldsymbol r} B_c = \frac{8\pi}{3} \mu.
\end{equation}
%%%

Hence, for a number density $n$ of these charged particles, the fraction of canceling field to the background magnetic field is
%%%
\begin{equation}
\frac{B_c}{B} = \frac{n(mv_\bot^2/2)}{3 B^2/8\pi} < \frac{\rho_K}{3\rho_B},
\end{equation}
%%%
where $\rho_K$ and $\rho_B$ are the kinetic energy density and the magnetic energy density, respectively. 
%If the initial velocity is not perpendicular to the magnetic field, $v$ must everywhere be replaced by its perpendicular component.

Just inside the stand-off point, 
%%%

and thus $\rho_K/\rho _B < 1$. 
When the particle spirals into the planet, 
the magnetic pressures increases (by beaming?) by

\begin{equation}
\frac{B^2}{8\pi } \propto \frac{1}{r^6}

On the other hand, the kinetic energy of the moment increases

\begin{equation}
\frac{mv^2}{2} \propto \frac{1}{r}

Therefore, unless the density increases more drastically than $1/r^5$, the ratio $B_c/B$ is significantly less than unity. 

%It is interesting to note that, for a plasma of protons and electrons in a stellar wind, the canceling field is clearly dominated by the contribution of protons, though the cyclotron emission is dominated by electrons.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conc}

In this paper, we propose that ``hot Jupiters'' around evolved stars (RGHJ) may be bright radio wave emitters, on the assumption of the simple empirical correlation between the radio emission and the kinetic input energy. 
Massive stellar wind of red giants and AGB stars would put the kinetic energy into magnetospheres of distant Jovian planets, which could lead to the intrinsic bright radio emission, comparable to or greater than canonical hot Jupiters in close-in orbits. 

The maximum radio emission we can expect to observe is limited by the plasma cut-off frequency of the stellar wind in the vicinity of the planets. 
For a planet with the same magnetic moment as Jupiter, the maximum radio emission from the planets which can penetrate through the surrounding plasma is $\sim 10^{-3}$ Jy or $\sim 10^{-5}$ Jy at 10 pc and 100 pc, respectively. 
\memoYF{comment on observability...}

Admittedly, uncertainties exist in the relation between radio emission of Jovian planets and the input energy from stellar wind, as well as in the scaling of planetary magnetic field. 
Alternatively, once we detect both the gravitational perturbation and radio emission of Jovian planets, these models will be contested. The viability of these scaling relations will be examined in the future. 

%The planetary magnetic moment is computed based on the simple scaling relationship given by \citep{christensen2010}.

The cyclotron frequency at radius $r$ is:
%%%
\begin{equation}
f_{\rm cyc} = \frac{e B(r)}{2\pi m_e} \propto \frac{B_p}{r^3}
\end{equation}
%%
Therefore, 
%%%
\begin{equation}
\frac{dP}{df_{\rm cyc}} = \frac{dP}{d\nu } \propto -\frac{r^4}{B_p} \frac{dP}{dr}
\end{equation}
%%%
Employing Larmor formula, power emitted from a thin shell at $r\sim r+dr$, $dP/dr$ is 
%%%
\begin{equation}
\frac{dP}{dr} \propto 4\pi r^2 N_{\rm plasma}(r) v_{\bot }^2(r) B^2(r) \label{eq:larmor}
\end{equation}
%%%
where $N_{\rm plasma}(r) $ represents the number density of plasma in the planetary magnetosphere at radius $r$. 

We assume that $N_{\rm plasma}(r_s) $  is proportional to the squared radius of the magnetic stand-off point:
%%%
\begin{equation}
N_{\rm plasma}(r_s) \propto \pi r_s^2 \;\;(\propto B_p^{2/3}) \label{eq:N0_plasma}
\end{equation}
%%%
Due the the mass flux conservation,
%%%
\begin{equation}
4 \pi r^2 N_{\rm plasma}(r) v_{\|} = const.
\end{equation}
%%%
Combining with equation (\ref{eq:N0_plasma}),
%%%
\begin{equation}
N_{\rm plasma}(r) \propto  \frac{r_s^2 }{v_{\|}(r) r^2} \propto  B_p^{2/3} \cdot \frac{v_{\|}(r)}{r^2}
\end{equation}
%%%

Because the magnetic dipole moment
%%%
\begin{equation}
\mu = \frac{mv_{\bot}(r)}{eB(r)}
\end{equation}
%%%
is approximately to be constant while the plasma falls down along the magnetic field, 
%%%
\begin{eqnarray}
v_{\bot }(r) \propto \frac{1}{r^3} \label{eq:v_bot} \\
B(r) \propto \frac{B_p}{r^3} 
\end{eqnarray}
%%%
On the other hand, conservation of energy ensures that
%%%
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{E} = -\frac{GM_p}{r} + \frac{v_{\bot }^2}{2} + \frac{v_{\|}^2}{2}=const.
\end{equation}
%%%
Assuming that the initial energy (at $r=r_s$) is negligible compared to those near the surface, $\mathcal{E}=0$, 
%%%
\begin{equation}
v_{\|}^2 \sim \frac{GM_p}{r} - \frac{v_{\bot ,0}^2}{2} \left( \frac{r}{r_s} \right)^{-6} \label{eq:v_||}
\end{equation}
%%%

Substituting equations (\ref{eq:N0_plasma}),  (\ref{eq:v_bot}) and (\ref{eq:v_||}) into equation (\ref{eq:larmor}) leads to
%%%
\begin{equation}
\frac{dP}{dr} \propto \frac{B_p^{8/3}}{r^{12}} \left( \frac{GM_p}{r} - \frac{v_{\bot ,0}^2}{2} \left( \frac{r}{r_s} \right)^{-6} \right)^{1/2}  
\end{equation}
%%%
The right-hand side has the maximum value $\sqrt{5GM_p/6\tilde r} $ at radius $\tilde r=(6v_{\bot ,0}^2/GM_p)^{1/5}$. 
At $r>>\tilde r$, 
%%%
\begin{equation}
\frac{dP}{dr} \propto \frac{B_p^{8/3}}{r^{25/2}}
\end{equation}
%%%
and
%%%
\begin{equation}
\frac{dP}{d\nu } \propto \frac{B_p^{5/3}}{r^{17/2}} \propto \frac{\nu^{17/6}}{B_p^{7/6}}
\end{equation}
%%%


At $r<<\tilde r$, 
%%%
\begin{equation}
\frac{dP}{dr} \propto \frac{B_p^{8/3}}{r^{15}}
\end{equation}
%%%
and
%%%
\begin{equation}
\frac{dP}{d\nu } \propto \frac{B_p^{5/3}}{r^{11}} \propto \frac{\nu^{11}}{B_p^{28/3}}

\memoDS{Is this section needed anymore, since this is already in the Griesmeier paper?
Does the Griesmeier paper make the point explicit enough, or is this still somewhat valuable?
Also, are we 100\% sure that this section is right?
A planet with larger surface field achieves an equivalent field to a planet with a smaller surface field at a larger radius, and captures a larger wind flux.
Should we think more about the spectrum?}





According to Eq.~(\ref{eq:Pkinp}), the total emitted power scales with $B^{2/3}$.
In detail, it is not obvious how the power spectral density scales with a planet's surface magnetic field, because the emission process involves electrons passing through a wide range of magnetic field conditions (dipolar field strength drops off as $r^{-3}$, and only in an idealized model is a planet a perfect magnetic dipole).
Nevertheless, a reasonable ansatz is that the radio emission is spread over a range of wavelengths in an approximately scale-independent way.
In other words, the frequency bandwidth $\Delta f$ of Eq.~(\ref{eq:Fnu}) is proportional to $f_{\rm cyc}$, as described in Section~\ref{ss:model_intensity} and in \citet{griesmeier2007b}.
This means that the power spectral density is likely to scale as the total power divided by the cyclotron frequency corresponding to a characteristic field strength where the emission peaks.
Since $f_{\rm cyc}$ scales as $B$ (a higher power of $B$ than the scaling of total power), this implies that the power spectral density in the radio scales as $B^{-1/3}$.
Planets that are intrinsically brighter, owing to a greater magnetic field strength, probably have their emission spread out over a broader set of frequencies, and therefore have a lower flux density as measured in Janskys!
\memoDS{Is this pointed out elsewhere in the literature?}

\citep{saar2001}: Inverse rossby number scaling of magnetic field: $B
\sim 60 {\rm~G} \times Ro^{-1.2}$.  Here, he takes $Ro = \tau_c/P_{\rm
  rot}$, where $\tau_c$ is the convective turnover time = ?
\citep{gilliland1986}.  Well, $F \sim \rho v_c^3 \sim \rho
(H/\tau_c)^3$, so $\tau_c \sim H (\rho / F)^{1/3} = H / (\sigma T_{\rm
  eff}^4 / \rho)^{1/3}$.  Alternatively, $\tau_{\rm conv} \sim (M R^2
/ L)^{1/3}$.

On dimensional grounds, the convective turnover time goes as
$\tau_{\rm conv} \sim (M R^2 / L)^{1/3}$.  According to
\citet{burrows_et_al2001}, radius $R$ and luminosity scale with time
as $R \sim R_J$, where $R_J$ is the radius of Jupiter, and
\begin{equation}
\frac{L}{10^{-9} L_\odot} \sim \left( \frac{t}{1 \rm~Gyr} \right)^{-1.3} \left( \frac{M}{1~M_J} \right)^{2.64} \, .
\label{eq:burrowsLum_2}
\end{equation}
So,
%\begin{eqnarray}
%\nonumber \tau_{\rm conv} & \sim & 3 {\rm~days} \times \left( \frac{M}{M_J} \right)^{1/3} \left( \frac{R}{R_J} \right)^{2/3} \left( \frac{L}{L_\odot} \right)^{-1/3} \\

\begin{eqnarray}
\nonumber \tau_c & \sim & 3 {\rm~hrs} \times \frac{\left( \frac{H}{100 \rm~km} \right) \left( \frac{\rho}{10^{-5} \rm~g~cm^{-3}} \right)^{1/3}}{\left( \frac{L}{10^{-9} L_\odot} \right)^{1/3}} \\
 & = & 3 {\rm~hrs} \times \frac{\left( \frac{H}{100 \rm~km} \right) \left( \frac{\rho}{10^{-5} \rm~g~cm^{-3}} \right)^{1/3}}{\left( \frac{M}{1 ~M_J} \right)^{0.88} \left( \frac{t}{1 \rm~Gyr} \right)^{0.43}} \\
\end{eqnarray}
So the Rossby number $Ro = \tau_c/P_{\rm rot}$ is
\begin{eqnarray}
Ro & = & \frac{\tau_c}{P_{\rm rot}} \\
 & = & \left( \frac{P_{\rm rot}}{3 \rm~hrs} \right)^{-1} \times \frac{\left( \frac{H}{100 \rm~km} \right) \left( \frac{\rho}{10^{-5} \rm~g~cm^{-3}} \right)^{1/3}}{\left( \frac{M}{1 ~M_J} \right)^{0.88} \left( \frac{t}{1 \rm~Gyr} \right)^{0.43}}

\begin{equation}
\dot{M}_* = 4\pi r^2 \rho[r] v \, ,

so $\rho[r] = \dot{M}_*/(4\pi r^2 v)$,
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\rho v^2}{2} = \frac{B^2}{8\pi} \sim \frac{B_0^2}{8\pi} \left( \frac{d}{d_0} \right)^{-3} \, ,

where $B_0$ is the field strength at a distance $d_0$ from the planet.

\frac{\dot{M}_* v}{8\pi a^2} & = & \frac{B_0^2}{8\pi} \left( \frac{d}{d_0} \right)^{-6} \\

\end{eqnarray}
In the above, $d_A$ is the distance from the planet to the Alfven
point, where the magnetic energy density $u_B = B^2 / 8\pi$ equals the
kinetic energy density in the stellar wind $u_w = \rho v^2/2$, and
$B_0$ is the magnetic field strength at distance $d_0$.

The escape speed is
\begin{equation}
v_{\rm esc}^* = \sqrt{\frac{2 G M_*}{R_*}} \, ,

Note that $\rho v = \dot{M}_*/4\pi r^2$.  Therefore,

\subsection{Assumptions for Planetary Magnetic Field}
%\label{ss:magneticfield}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\memoYF{It may be better to consider Cristensen's scaling, taking account of the age. But I have not followed the theory yet.}

Theoretically, the magnetic moment of gaseous planets are expressed with the following scaling relationship \citep{griesmeier2004}:
%%%%%%%%%% 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{M} \propto  \omega ^{\alpha } \rho_c ^{\beta } r_c^{\gamma } \sigma ^{\delta }
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%
where $\omega $ is the spin angular velocity, $\rho _c$, $r_c$ and $\sigma $ are the density, the radius, and the conductivity of the ``dynamo region'' where the density is high enough for hydrogen to be metallic, respectively. 
The scaling indexes are estimated to be $\alpha \sim 1/2-1$, $\beta \sim 1/2$, $\gamma \sim 3-4$, and $\sigma \sim -1/2-0$. In this paper, we assume $\alpha =1$, $\beta =1/2$, and $r_c = 7/2$ \citep{sano1993}. \memoYF{validity?}

Unlike usual hot jupiters, RGHJs are not subject to tidal lock, as the gravitational effects of their host star does not change even if the star evolves into red giants. Without no physical insights of the typical spin rate, we simply assume that of Jupiter: $\omega = 9.925$ [hr]. 
\memoYF{Would their spin rate become higher or lower??}

In order to evaluate $\rho _c $ and $r_c$, we need a model of internal structure of gaseous planets. 
First, we assume that the planetary radius is constant at $R_p = R_{p,J}$, as the numerical calculations show that the radii of gaseous planets over the range of $0.1 R_{p, J} < M_p < 10M_{p, J}$ (with core mass less than 10\%) are converged to $0.8 R_{p, J} < R_p < 1.2R_{p, J}$ in 1 Gyr \citep{fortney2007}. 
For the density profile, we assume a polytrope gas sphere with index $n=1$, which results in:
%%%%%%%%%% 
\begin{equation}
\rho [r] = \left( \frac{\pi M_p}{4 R_p^3} \right) \frac{\sin \left[ \pi \frac{r}{R_p} \right]}{\left( \pi \frac{r}{R_p} \right)}. \label{eq:rho_r_2}
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%
We determine the core radius $r_c$ by assuming that the hydrogen becomes metallic when $\rho (r)$ exceeds the critical density $\rho_c=700\,\mbox{kg/m}^3$. The density of the metallic core, $\rho _c$ is obtained by averaging the density in the core. 
We assume that the conductivity $\sigma $ is the same as Jupiter \memoYF{?}.
